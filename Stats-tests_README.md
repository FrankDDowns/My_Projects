Stats-tests
This script analyzes data, performing ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests based on normality and homogeneity checks for unique groupings. 
Then performs a Tukey test on data groupings with significant ANOVA results, generating Compact Letter Displays and bar charts with 
confidence intervals error bars. CSV and a pdf files including results are generated.
